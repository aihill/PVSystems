ERROR: Failed to solve non-linear system using Newton solver.
 It could be that:
* the starting values are too far from the solution
 - especially if this occurs at the starting point (see homotopy in the manual) - in rare cases it could occur at events
 * the equations are too discontinuous for the non-linear solver (likely due to over-using noEvent) - the residual will have knees,
 * the equations have no solution (note that in some cases the event-logic can cause this) - the residual will be above zero.
Jacobian has inverse norm 1.44444 and condition number 1.
